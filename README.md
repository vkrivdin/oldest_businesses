# General

In this project I have:
- Cleaned and Preprocessed Data: Ensured the data was in a suitable state for analysis by handling missing values, duplicates, and normalizing the data.
- Gained Insights: Through statistical analysis and visualization, you gained insights into the data's distribution, correlations, and other key characteristics.
- Developed Analytical Skills: Demonstrated proficiency in using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

# Input

- [businesses.csv](./datasets/businesses.csv)
- [new_businesses.csv](./datasets/new_businesses.csv)
- [categories.csv](./datasets/categories.csv)
- [countries.csv](./datasets/countries.csv)

# Output

- [notebook.ipynb](./notebook.ipynb)

# Applied concepts

- Libraries
  - pandas, numpy
- Data Cleaning
  - Handling missing values using df.dropna() or df.fillna()
  - Removing duplicates with df.drop_duplicates()
  - Data normalization or standardization
- Data Transformation:
  - Using pd.melt() to reshape data.
  - Applying pd.pivot_table() for data aggregation.
  - Using groupby() and agg() functions for grouping and aggregating data.
- Data Analysis:
  - Statistical analysis using numpy and scipy.
  - Correlation analysis with df.corr().
- Conditional Statements and Loops
  - Used for data filtering or iterative processing.
- Functions
  - Defined custom functions to perform specific tasks, such as data preprocessing or feature engineering.

# Project brief

Provided by DataCamp:

> An essential part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the business survives changing market conditions.
> In this project, you'll explore data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses. You'll use joining and data manipulation techniques to answer questions about these historic businesses.
>
> Staffelter Hof Winery is Germany's oldest business, established in 862 under the Carolingian dynasty. It has continued to serve customers through dramatic changes in Europe, such as the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and both world wars. What characteristics enable a business to stand the test of time?
> 
> To help answer this question, BusinessFinancing.co.uk researched the oldest company still in business in **almost** every country and compiled the results into several CSV files. This dataset has been cleaned.
> 
> Having useful information in different files is a common problem. While it's better to keep different types of data separate for data storage, you'll want all the data in one place for analysis. You'll use joining and data manipulation to work with this data and better understand the world's oldest businesses.
